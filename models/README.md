# Models Directory

Place ONNX, Flax, or TFLite weights here. The repository ships with heuristic simulators, but the adapters are structured to drop in real artifacts at:

- `models/s_net.onnx`
- `models/m_net.onnx`
- `models/s_net_flax/params.msgpack`
- `models/tflite/*.tflite`

Use Git LFS for large binaries.
